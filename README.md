# H-Sets: Uncovering Feature Interactions in Image Classification using Hessian

Repository for "H-Sets: Uncovering Feature Interactions in Image Classification using Hessian," submitted to Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 2025. 

Our paper proposes an approach to incorporate feature interaction into saliency maps for image classification. To run our code, you would need to download ImageNette from [here](https://github.com/fastai/imagenette).

## Dependencies
 - quantus (for sparsity and ROAD metrics)
 - opencv (for image processing)
 - captum (for saliency maps)
 - [SAM](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything.git) (for image segmentation)
