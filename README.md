# H-Sets: Uncovering Feature Interactions in Image Classification using Hessian

Repository for "H-Sets: Uncovering Feature Interactions in Image Classification using Hessian," submitted to Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition 2025 (CVPR) and accepted to the ATTRIB Workshop at Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems 2024 (NeurIPS). 

Our paper proposes an approach to incorporate feature interaction into saliency maps for image classification. To run our code, you would need to download ImageNette from [here](https://github.com/fastai/imagenette).
